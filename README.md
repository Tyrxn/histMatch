# satImageBlend

satImageBlend is a tool for QGIS that can process satellite images to make both color gradients the same, allowing for more accurate land classification. The tool can be used to enhance the quality of satellite imagery by reducing color variation and making it easier to distinguish different land cover types. This can be particularly useful for applications such as environmental management, urban planning, and flood modeling.
